2.3.1 (2015-08-19)
------------------

- Add an `UnicodeCoercingText` TypeDecorator for the `Text` type that
  always returns unicode for values fetched from the DB. This allows
  us to have a guarantee to always receive unicode for `Text` types,
  even when using Oracle as the backend.
  The effect of this TypeDecorator should be the same as the cxOracle
  dialect option `coerce_to_unicode`, which unfortunately only affects
  `String` columns.
